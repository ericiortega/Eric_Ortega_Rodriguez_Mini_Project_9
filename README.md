## Project Overview
This mini project nine involves setting up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook (in our case, we will be using Google Colab) to perform data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset. The dataset used is a cereal dataset that contains nutritional information about different types of cereals.

The main objective is to demonstrate data analysis skills using Python, including loading the dataset, performing data manipulations, and visualizing the data through a heatmap. The final deliverable is a public repository containing the notebook and relevant documentation.

## Requirements
- Set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook (e.g., Google Colab).
- Perform data manipulation tasks on the cereal dataset.
- Use a CI/CD pipeline for automation.
- Include a README.md for documentation.

## Project Contents
- **Notebook Link**: [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xZBn7ZplXxKaI8pLqXg1TL0k9AY1cuce#scrollTo=a0qCKMtT67o2)
- **Repository Link**: [Public GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ericiortega/Eric_Ortega_Rodriguez_Mini_Project_9)

## Data Manipulation Tasks
The following data manipulation tasks were performed on the cereal dataset:

1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - The dataset was loaded from a CSV file hosted on GitHub. This was the CSV used in a previous mini project. 

2. **Displaying Initial Data**:
   - Showed the first few rows of the dataset to get a quick overview of our data.

3. **Filter High-Calorie Cereals**:
   - Filtered cereals that have more than 100 calories to analyze cereals that are higher within the energy content.

4. **Average Sugar Content Calculation**:
   - Calculated the average sugar content across all cereals to understand the different levels of sugar in the dataset.

5. **Sorting by Protein Content**:
   - Sorted the cereals based on their protein content in descending order to identify the most protein-rich cereals.

6. **Heatmap Visualization**:
   - Created a heatmap to visualize the calorie content of different cereals. This allows us to identify cereals with the highest calorie counts more effectively.

## Setup and Configuration
- The Google Colab environment was used for the notebook.
- The dataset was loaded directly from GitHub to ensure reproducibility and accessibility.

## CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline was implemented to automate the validation and deployment of the notebook. This helps ensure continuous integration.

## Deliverables
- **Link to the Cloud-Hosted Notebook**: The notebook is hosted in Google Colab, and a link has been provided above.
- **Demonstration Document/Video**: A demonstration of the data manipulation tasks performed is included in the repository. A visualization was also included.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Open the link to the Google Colab notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
3. Make sure that all required libraries are installed and imported.
